## GSoC Project

- [GSoC Project URL](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/9bSOdy71)
- [Work Repository](https://github.com/sidd-2203/cellminercdb)

Mentor:
**Augustin Luna** ([@cannin](https://github.com/cannin))

## Tasks

1. [Color nodes with Average across all samples](https://github.com/cannin/gsoc_2023_cellminercdb_networks/issues/3).  
    Status: **Completed**.        
    
    Nodes are colored as per the average values of the genes depicted in the table.


2. [Draw Diagram in Pathway Mapper and use in CellMinerCDB](https://github.com/cannin/gsoc_2023_cellminercdb_networks/issues/10).  
    Status: **Completed**.        
    
    A file exported from the pathway mapper can be imported in CellMinerCDB and the pathway can be visualized.
   

3. [Rename LFC in basicStyle.js](https://github.com/cannin/gsoc_2023_cellminercdb_networks/issues/11).  
    Status: **Completed**.

    Renamed lfc to avgValues and used it to set color.     
     

4. [Color nodes without values to grey](https://github.com/cannin/gsoc_2023_cellminercdb_networks/issues/15).  
    Status: **Completed**.  

    The nodes whose values are not present in cellminerCDB is colored by default to grey rather than white.

5. [Add Arrows to interactions](https://github.com/cannin/gsoc_2023_cellminercdb_networks/issues/16).  
    Status: **Completed**.  

    Adding arrows to edges(interactions) with the same color as interaction.


## Next Step

- Share Progress with Augustin and talk on bug fixes to some module and prepare to present the progress with other users of CellMinerCDB.
- Solving the rest of the open issues.
