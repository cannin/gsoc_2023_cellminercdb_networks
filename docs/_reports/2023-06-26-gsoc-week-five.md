## Holiday

- Was on leave from 28th June to 4th July as I had to travel to Banglore.

## Tasks

1. [Calculate maximum and minimum for all genes](https://github.com/cannin/gsoc_2023_cellminercdb_networks/issues/12).  
    Status: **To Do**.  

2. [Include all Genes in select gene](https://github.com/cannin/gsoc_2023_cellminercdb_networks/issues/13).  
    Status: **To Do**.  


3. [Use Camel Case Naming Convention](https://github.com/cannin/gsoc_2023_cellminercdb_networks/issues/14).  
    Status: **To Do**.

4. [COADREAD WNT Pathway Complexes Error Matching colors](https://github.com/cannin/gsoc_2023_cellminercdb_networks/issues/18).  
    Status: **In Progress**.

    Pathways containg the groups of genes are causing this error,thinking of ways to solve this.

5. [Begin Intergrating the demo code in CellMinerCDB](https://github.com/cannin/gsoc_2023_cellminercdb_networks/issues/20).  
    Status: **In Progress**.        
    

6. [Make Option to Select Cell Line or Tissue](https://github.com/cannin/gsoc_2023_cellminercdb_networks/issues/22).  
    Status: **To Do**.        
    
7. [Simplify Demo](https://github.com/cannin/gsoc_2023_cellminercdb_networks/issues/23).  
    Status: **To Do**.        
    
8. [Allow users to set lower and upper threshold](https://github.com/cannin/gsoc_2023_cellminercdb_networks/issues/24).  
    Status: **To Do**.

9. [Show a Color Bar](https://github.com/cannin/gsoc_2023_cellminercdb_networks/issues/26).  
    Status: **In Progress**. 

10. [Change Interaction Colors](https://github.com/cannin/gsoc_2023_cellminercdb_networks/issues/27).  
    Status: **Completed**.        

    There was some confusion between the interaction colors mentioned in the slides and the actual implementation which was solved.    

## Next Step

- Share Progress with Augustin. 
- Solving the rest of the open issues.
