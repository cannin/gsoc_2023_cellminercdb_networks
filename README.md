# About the Project

[CellMinerCDB](https://discover.nci.nih.gov/rsconnect/cellminercdb/) provides a web-based resource for integrating multiple forms of pharmacological and genomic analyses, and unifying the richest cancer cell line datasets (the NCI-60, Sanger/MGH GDSC, and Broad CCLE/CTRP).
This project will be aiming towards an additional module in this project for visulization of averaged genetic profiling data on top of some curated set of pathways.The project is inspired by [PathwayMapper](https://www.pathwaymapper.org/#).
